<% model = 'Webhook' %>
# Webhooks

```plaintext
<%= partial 'partials/endpoints', locals: { plural: 'webhooks' } %>
```

Webhooks allow subscribing to changes on most data models in Space Invoices.

When a Webhook subscription for a model event is triggered a POST request is sent to the registered URL.

If the request returns a 2\*\* status the process is complete.

If a non 2\*\* status is returned three additional re-tries will be made in 2 minutes, 4 minutes and finally in 8 minutes after the initial request.

## The Webhook object

## Supported model events

The following event types can be used when registering a Webhook subscription

`create`, `update` and `delete`
