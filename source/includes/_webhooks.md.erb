```

Webhooks allow subscribing to changes on most data models in Space Invoices.

When a Webhook subscription for a model event is triggered a POST request is sent to the registered URL.

If the request returns a 2\*\* status the process is complete.

If a non 2\*\* status is returned three additional re-tries will be made in 2 minutes, 4 minutes and finally in 8 minutes after the initial request.
