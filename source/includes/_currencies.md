# Currencies

Currencies are provided and available to load from our system, if a currency is missing please let us know so we can add it.

Besides the normal (fiat) currencies we have now also added some common cryptocurrencies.

Note: ISO 4217 unique currency codes are used as `id` fields of currencies to simlify inclusion as related IDs in documents.
