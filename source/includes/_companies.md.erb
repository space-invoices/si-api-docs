Companies is a special read-only searchable collection of companies from public directories. If looking for an endpont to add user companies please refer to the [Organizations](#organizations) section.

This data model is recommended for user interfaces as a "search while you type feature", allowing you to limit searches to specific countries based on the origin of the user.

We update this database as frequently as possible to ensure most recent data.
