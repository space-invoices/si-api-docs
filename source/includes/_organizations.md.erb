# Organizations

> **Endpoints:**

```plaintext
  POST /v1/accounts/:id/organizations
   GET /v1/organizations/:id
 PATCH /v1/organizations/:id
   GET /v1/accounts/:id/organizations
   GET /v1/accounts/:id/organizations/count
  POST /v1/organizations/images
DELETE /v1/organizations/images
   GET /v1/organizations/images
  POST /v1/organizations/:id/deactivate
  POST /v1/organizations/:id/activate

  POST /v1/organizations/:id/invite
   GET /v1/organizations/:id/accountorganizations
   GET /v1/organizations/:id/stats
```

**Any given Account can control multiple Organizations. They may either create these Organizations themselves or other users may assign access rights of existing organizations to these given accounts.**

This is especially useful when there is a need to manage multiple organizations, as they are created for users that might signup for a certain product.

Most of the models created though the API are related to an Organization instance.

**This endpoint allows the uploading of a Logo or a Signature image for a given organization. The image is then automatically used in all documents when generating a PDF.**

To check if an organization has a logo or signature image set, we simply need to check an organization's `_defaults` object for keys containing `image_logo` or `image_signature` where the key is set to `true`.  
The \_defaults object is retrieved with the organization when querying it or by separately querying the [Defaults](#defaults).

```

<%= partial "partials/#{model2.downcase}.returns", locals: { type: 'add' } %>

This endpoint allows adding users ([Accounts](#accounts)) to Organizations, granting the user access rights to perform actions on the particular Organization.

It's not required for the invited user to have an Account prior to inviting them, when inviting with email the API will link the Account of the invited user when they sign up. In this case the invitation email will direct the user to sign up.

**To silently add a user to an Organization simply set both `requireConfirmation` and `sendEmail` to `false`.**  
The added user can then be logged in or controled using the [impersonate](#impersonate-an-account) method.  
_Note that the Account must already exist otherwise one must be signed up._

<%= partial 'partials/route.parameters', locals: { model: model, noFk: true, action: 'invited to', modelId: true, modelAction: 'invite' } %>
