# Companies

Companies is a searchable collection of companies and organizations maintained.
This function greatly simplifies the process of issuing documents.

This database is recommended for user interfaces should you setup a "search while you type feature", allowing you to limit searches to specific countries based on the origin of the user.

We update this database as frequently as possible to ensure usability and convenience.
