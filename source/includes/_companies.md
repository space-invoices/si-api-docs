# Companies

Companies is a searchable collection of companies and organization we maintain and is available to simplify issuing documents.

It is recommended to use this database for user interfaces as a search while you type feature but to limit searches to specific countries based on user's origin.

We are adding to this database slowly country by country.
The database is updated regularly as frequently as we can query the data for each country.

Current status:
- [x] Slovenia (production API)
- [ ] Hungary (coming soon)

Accepting votes and data sources for other countries.
