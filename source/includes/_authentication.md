# Authentication

> Authorization token should be used to make calls to the API:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.spaceinvoices.com/v1/..."
  -H "Authorization: TOKEN"
```

```javascript
var spaceInvoices = new SpaceInvoices('TOKEN');
```

```csharp
SpaceConfiguration.SetApiKey("TOKEN");
```



> Make sure to replace `TOKEN` with your authorization token.

Space Invoices uses authorization tokens to allow access to the API. A token can be aquired from the developer dashboard [Mission Control](http://spaceinvoices.com/signup).

The API key has to be included in all API requests to the server in a header like this:

`Authorization: TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">You must replace <code>TOKEN</code> with your obtained token.</aside>
